ISSUES: 

- "Irssi: critical nicklist_set_host: assertion 'host != NULL' failed"


- after setting a user to be an operator in a channel, the message does not get sent to the channel (not sure if this is a problem)
- the message confirming user is an operator does not specify the channel.
- /names still does not update properly after user is made operator.
